Hello World Project from GitHub, Creating a README File.
--------------------------------------------------------
My name is Eric Sparkman, I am a web developer learning to utilize some of the more modern technologies available to a computer scientist. To that end, tensorflow with nodeJS was chosen as the avenue through which higher learning will be explored. 

I have a partially working website (I know, shame right?) hosted at: vorticieflux6626.ihostfull.com, and locally offline on my Dell Laptop running Arch Linux (LAMP stack). As I gain skill with GitHub, I hope to reframe the entire web project as well. 

I will be beginning, after this tutorial, to use the sparkone.json package file (NodeJS).
